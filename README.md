# Algorithms and data structure

Definition
A set of steps or instruction for completeing a task

fundamentals

- clearly defined problem statement, inputs an outputs
- steps should be in specific order
- steps need to be distinct
- algorithms dhould produce a result
- algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time

linear search
binary search
